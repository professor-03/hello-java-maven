# hello-java-maven
My 8th project as an intern at elevate labs where i was required to work with java, maven and jenkins.

Steps that i took to make this project a successful one:

-Created an ec2 instance and made the directories as per the requirement and initialised git in it.

-Created the java hello world app and the .xml file respectively.

-installed docker and executed to docker command to successfully fetch the jenkins image and the required dependencies.

-Then did the other requirements in the jenkins url page and build the pipeline.

-After repeated tries it was a successfull execution of the project.
